# New York Air Quality 
#### This repository was created for my English 105 class.
### Contents
This repository contains:
* 1 Python notebook with steps to create the primary data subset
* 2 Folders with files related to the folder's title
* 2 PNG files that consist of the visuals used
* 4 CSV files that consist of the original, the main subset, and two smaller ones created during visualization
### Source of Data
This repository uses public data from New York City, hosted by [Data.Gov.](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/air-quality)  
### Purpose of Data
This repository and subset were created to study two specific areas, Manhattan and Queens, alongside their respective concentrations of PM 2.5 and NO2. Both of these can cause breathing problems at high concentrations as PM 2.5 represents larger particles suspended in the air, and NO2 also has a long list of potential side effects, such as lung disease. Monitoring the trends associated with these two can paint an image of air quality over time and the prevalence of pollution-creating activities. Since the original dataset has more New York city areas, it is possible to compare other areas alongside O3 (Ozone) concentration, which is tracked in other areas.
### Potential Uses of Data
* Comparison of various parts of New York City in regards to the presence of harmful pollutants in the air to direct efforts of pollution prevention
* Analyze the prevalence of pollutants over time in the air to gauge pollution levels and the effectiveness of current policies
* Finding out which of the 3 tracked particles (O3, PM 2.5, and NO2) are the most concentrated to direct policy making
* Examining which season tends to have a higher concentration of pollution to further studies into factors behind the difference
### Visualization
* The two visualizations were created using [Flourish](https://flourish.studio/), which requires signing up for a free account
* The original subset was filtered slightly more in Excel to isolate the individual particles for examination; this can also be done in Flourish, but it is easier to delete large amounts of rows in Excel
